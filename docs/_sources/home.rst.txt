TNO Quantum is dedicated to developing reusable software components for applying current
and near-term quantum technology. Our code base is use-case driven and contains fully-functional,
self-contained software components, which can be used as building blocks to enable further development 
of quantum applications. 

Our current open-source packages focus on:

1. Optimization
2. Machine learning
3. Secure communication

Furthermore, we demonstrate the usability of our tools by applying them to real-world applications.
